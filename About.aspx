    <p>As you know my name is Steven Prestridge. I am from Hazlet New Jersey and I am currently practicing coding while very actively looking for a job. If you happened to stumble across this project I made
        on my Github account, I would like to thank you for taking a look! Some information you should know about me is that I am always willing to learn. Everyday I try to learn as much as possible about anything that comes to my mind,
        whether it be about computers, sports, or anything inbetween. I am also very much a listener as I am a contributer. When a group task comes to hand I want to hear everyones input 
        as well as give my own. I will always listen to understand, instead of listen to rebuttle. 
        The purpose of me writing this is in hopes of you getting a better understanding of who I am. However I do not want to ramble on too long, so if you like what you see and would like to know more about me feel free to click on the "Contact Me" page and you can feel free to give me a call whenever you like, or send me an email. Thank you.   
    </p>
